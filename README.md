# FC-GNN - Final Design Report

## Project Description
Functional connectomes are representations of brain connectivity, and classifying them has many uses in precision psychiatry. This project applies two kinds of graph neural networks to the task of FC fingerprinting: graph matching networks and Siamese graph convolutional networks. Graph neural networks can be used for matching and classifying functional connectomes due to their graph structure. My advisor for this project is Gowtham Atluri.
