# GNNS for FC Fingerprinting User Guide

Several deep neural networks can be trained on FC data using this pipeline. Variations of the graph matching network, Siamese graph neural network, and multilayer perceptron can be trained and evaluated on a real FC dataset or one of two types of randomly generated FC data. Plots and results are saved during the pipeline execution. This guide outlines the use of the pipeline for training and evaluating the models.
